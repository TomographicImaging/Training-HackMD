## :question: Your Questions

> [!TIP]
> To create a new question, make sure you're in edit mode then type `#####` in the relevant section below. A trainer will answer your question in *italics*

### General CIL and CT questions
##### How many channels does cil support?
*We can support multi-channel images e.g. hyperspectral or dynamic CT, with any number of channels. CIL Data containers have a maximum of 4 dimensions, 3 spatial + 1 *channel* dimension which could be energy or time, for instance.*
